<p>The Boost C++ libraries are a set of free peer-reviewed <a href="https://modulesafari.com/category/cpp">C++</a> libraries. They are intended to be useful for a wide variety of applications and portable. Boost just makes life easier, here is how to install it on Linux. </p>



<h2>Installing Boost using a package manager</h2>



<p>The easiest way to install Boost is with your built-in package manager. It takes care of the installation of all of the dependencies and is more likely to be using a very stable version of the library. Also, there is the added benefit of it being easy to remove if you no longer want it. </p>



<h3>Apt (Debian, Ubuntu, Pop OS, etc)</h3>



<p>On most Debian based systems, you can install all of the Boost libraries with a single command. </p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">apt-get install libboost-all-dev</pre>



<h3>DNF (Fedora, etc)</h3>



<p>The newer versions of Fedora now use Dandified Yum, instead of just regular yum. </p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">dnf install boost-devel</pre>



<h3>Yum (Centos, older versions of Fedora, etc)</h3>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">yum install boost-devel</pre>



<h2>Manual Installation</h2>



<p>If you require a different version of it than the one that is provided by your package manager, you can easily compile and install it manually. </p>



<h3>Dependencies</h3>



<p>Boost has very few dependencies. You mainly need just a C++ compiler and make. </p>



<ul><li>C++ compiler (g++, clang++, etc)</li><li>make</li></ul>



<h3>Installation</h3>



<p>With that out of the way, let&#8217;s get to the installation, do keep in mind that you will need to set the change the first few environment variables to what you would like them to be. </p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">export MAJOR_VERSION=1
export MINOR_VERSION=70
export PATCH_VERSION=0
wget https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/${MAJOR_VERSION}.${MINOR_VERSION}.${PATCH_VERSION}/source/boost_${MAJOR_VERSION}_${MINOR_VERSION}_${PATCH_VERSION}.tar.gz
tar -xzf boost_${MAJOR_VERSION}_${MINOR_VERSION}_${PATCH_VERSION}.tar.gz
cd boost_${MAJOR_VERSION}_${MINOR_VERSION}_${PATCH_VERSION}
./bootstrap.sh
./b2 install -j$(nproc)</pre>



<p>You should now have successfully installed Boost on your machine. For more details, I suggest taking a look at the <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html">official boost documentation</a></p>

<p class="blog"><a href="https://github.com/meltwater/served" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Served</a> is a C++ library for easy creation of highly performant web servers. It presents a clean and elegant modern C++ interface, drastically reducing the amount of boiler-plate code that would normally be needed. Overall, it looks very promising for when you want everything to just work, without compromising on performance. Now, let&#8217;s dive right into it. </p>



<h2>Getting To Hello World</h2>



<p>Getting started is fairly standard for a from-source installation, you can also opt to compile it into a deb or rpm package via the build flags. Running the following commands installs served on your system. This installation requires Boost 1.53 or newer, if you do not have Boost installed on your system, you can install it using your favorite package manager or by <a href="https://modulesafari.com/how-to-install-the-boost-c-libraries/">following these instructions</a>.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">git clone https://github.com/meltwater/served.git
mkdir served/served.build &amp;&amp; cd served/served.build
cmake ../served &amp;&amp; make
sudo make install</pre>



<p>Now, that you have it installed, it is time to build a simple webserver. This server will just give back &#8220;Hello world!&#8221; when you query against the endpoint <code>GET /hello.</code></p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="cpp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="4, 6-9, 11-12" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="main.cpp" data-enlighter-group="">#include &lt;served/served.hpp>

int main() {
	served::multiplexer mux;

	mux.handle("/hello")
		.get([](served::response &amp; res, const served::request &amp; req) {
			res &lt;&lt; "Hello world!\n";
		});

	served::net::server server("0.0.0.0", "8080", mux);
	server.run(10);

	return 0;
}</pre>



<p>To compile your program, you will need to link against the pthread, boost_system, and served shared objects, and use at least C++-11. On Linux, this would look roughly like the following.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">g++ main.cpp -o demo -std=c++17 -pthread -lboost_system -lserved</pre>



<p>Just run the binary and visit the URL <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="http://localhost:8080/hello" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/hello</a> in your browser, and you have successfully reached the hello-world. All of the code for this demo is <a href="https://github.com/moduledemos/served-demo">available on github</a>.</p>



<h2>Performance</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a quick look at the performance of C++ Served. At only 60k, the output binary from that demo is surprising small on my system. Of course, this is not the statically linked binary size. For this benchmark, we will be using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Vegeta (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta" target="_blank">Vegeta</a> for load testing. </p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">Requests      [total, rate, throughput]    99999, 20000.17, 19057.02
Duration      [total, attack, wait]        5.000256833s, 4.999908146s, 348.687µs
Latencies     [mean, 50, 90, 95, 99, max]  2.539834ms, 375.457µs, 7.240899ms, 8.184653ms, 38.421652ms, 1.691368283s

Status Codes  [code:count]                 0:4709  200:95290  

</pre>



<p>On my machine (Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60GHz 16 threads), the basic hello world server was able to handle around 19,000 requests per second! Additionally, it was able to maintain relatively low CPU usage during this attack, using only ~30% of the capacity available to it. </p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">Requests      [total, rate, throughput]    150000, 30000.10, 14094.09
Duration      [total, attack, wait]        7.948649187s, 4.999982507s, 2.94866668s

Bytes In      [total, mean]                1456377, 9.71
Bytes Out     [total, mean]                0, 0.00
Success       [ratio]                      74.69%
Status Codes  [code:count]                 0:37971  200:112029 </pre>



<p>As the request rate increases above 20k, the performance started to degrade. Here, it seems like 20k requests per second is the sweet spot. Despite this, the performance of the library is very satisfactory under the given load. The majority of requests took under 1ms when it was under the 20k stress test. This should be more than enough to meet the needs of all but the most extreme demands. </p>

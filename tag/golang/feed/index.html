<p><a href="https://github.com/vektra/mockery">Mockery is an awesome tool</a> that offers the ability to generate mocks from Go interfaces. Additionally, it&#8217;s output uses the <a href="https://modulesafari.com/testify-test-your-go-code/">testify</a> framework, so you can easily plug in your mocks and perform granular tests on your code. When combined with the power of a Makefile, it makes mocking a breeze. </p>



<h2>The Makefile</h2>



<p>Some people might be turned off by the use of a makefile. However, it is going to make this significantly more convenient, especially as your project grows.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="shell" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">GOC=go
GO111MODULE=on

DIRECTORIES=$(sort $(dir $(wildcard pkg/*/*/)))
MOCKS=$(foreach x, $(DIRECTORIES), mocks/$(x))

.PHONY: all test clean-mocks mocks

all: demo

demo:
	$(GOC) build -o demo

test: | mocks
	go test ./...

clean-mocks:
	rm -rf mocks

mocks: $(MOCKS)
	
$(MOCKS): mocks/% : %
	mockery -output=$@ -dir=$^ -all</pre>



<p>This makefile takes all of the subdirectories which match the pattern &#8220;pkg/*/*&#8221; and then matches them with an output to be in the folder <code>mocks/pkg/..<em>.</em></code> .  For each of these pairs, it makes a call to mockery with the -all flag. This flag tells it to mock all of the interfaces in a directory. </p>



<h2>The Go Code to Mock</h2>



<p>For this example, we will have a Teller struct, which exports a method Tell. This method takes in a story and reads it chapter by chapter to an audience far and wide. Here is what the story interface and Teller struct look like.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">type Story interface {
	ReadChapter(chapter int) ([]byte, error)
	HasChapter(chapter int) bool
}</pre>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">type Teller struct {
}

func (teller Teller) say(words []byte) {
	//Pretend this makes it talk
}

func (teller Teller) Tell(story Story) error {
	for i := 0; story.HasChapter(i); i++ {
		words, err := story.ReadChapter(i)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		teller.say(words)
	}
	return nil
}</pre>



<p>How can you make sure that the Teller reads every single chapter until there are no more in the story? You mock the story! First, you must generate the mocks with the command <code>make mocks</code> (or you can just run the test with <code>make test</code>, it knows to make the calls to mockery first). Here is our tester code for the Teller.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="14-15,17, 19, 23" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">import (
	"testing"

	demoMock "github.com/moduledemos/mockery-demo/mocks/pkg/demo"

	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/mock"
)

func TestTeller_Tell(t *testing.T) {
	teller := Teller{}
	story := new(demoMock.Story)
	noChapters := 20
	story.On("ReadChapter", mock.Anything).Return(
		[]byte(":)"), nil).Times(noChapters)
	for i := 0; i &lt; noChapters; i++ {
		story.On("HasChapter", i).Return(true).Once()
	}
	story.On("HasChapter", noChapters).Return(false).Once()
	err := teller.Tell(story)
	assert.NoError(t, err)

	story.AssertExpectations(t)
}</pre>



<p>You can see that we can mock different return values for the <code>HasChapter</code> function based on the input given to it. Additionally, you might notice <code>.Times(n)</code> or <code>.Once</code> appended to the call to <code>.On</code>. When combined with the call to <code>AssertExpectations</code> at the end, this enforces the number of times each variation is called. </p>



<p>If it does not matter what the input is, you can use the global <code>mock.Anything</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify">testify library</a> to match with any given input. With all of these features, I was able to create a test that ensured that all of the chapters would be read until the function HasChapter returned false. All of this, in just ~12 lines of code. If you like doing more work with less code, then I highly recommend using mockery and testify for all of your Go testing needs.</p>

<p>Testify is a testing library that makes writing tests for your Go code easy. It reduces the amount of code you need for tests, while also providing extra functionality for easy mocking. Especially when combined with mockery, you really have a Golang testing powerhouse. Here is a <a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify">direct link</a> to the Github repository if you are interested.</p>



<h2>Assert</h2>



<p>Testify&#8217;s assert package contains functions that make checking certain conditions easy. They replace the normal if statement list flow and have reflection built-in for comparisons between structs. For this example, let&#8217;s say we are making a function fib, which calculates the number in the nth place in the Fibonacci Sequence. Here is our naive implementation of this, which has a few issues.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">func fib(n int64) int64 {
	var a int64 = 0
	var b int64 = 1
	for i := int64(0); i &lt; n-1; i++ {
		tmp := b
		b = a + b
		a = tmp
	}
	return b
}</pre>



<p>We want to be sure that this implementation is correct, so we add some tests for it using testify. </p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">package main

import(
	"testing"

	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestFib(t *testing.T) {
	assert.Equal(t, int64(0), fib(0))
	assert.Equal(t, int64(1), fib(1))
	assert.Equal(t, int64(1), fib(2))
	assert.Equal(t, int64(6765), fib(20))
}</pre>



<p>Now, we run our tests with <code>go test</code> and we can immediately see an issue.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">--- FAIL: TestFib (0.00s)
    fib_test.go:12: 
        	Error Trace:	fib_test.go:10
        	Error:      	Not equal: 
        	            	expected: 0
        	            	actual  : 1
        	Test:       	TestFib
FAIL</pre>



<p>Thanks to testify, we easily see that on line 10, the output of the function was 1, instead of 0. We go to our code and see that we don&#8217;t handle the case of n == 0, and fix the issue. </p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">func fib(n int64) int64 {
	var a int64 = 0
	var b int64 = 1
	for i := int64(0); i &lt; n; i++ {
		tmp := b
		b = a + b
		a = tmp
	}
	return a
}</pre>



<p>The tests passed, and we can be more confident that our code is correct. </p>



<h2>Require</h2>



<p>While assert is great for most cases, sometimes you have dependencies in your test function. There, you want to make sure that when a test fails, it reports only what failed. Enter the require package. Require feels like a carbon copy of the assert package, with just one key difference: it calls <code>t.FailNow()</code>.  Let&#8217;s make a function which uses the Fibonacci function from earlier, and outputs all terms up to n in an array. </p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">func fibAll(n int64) []int64 {
	if n > 0 {
		return nil
	}
	out := make([]int64, n + 1)
	for i := int64(0); i &lt;= n; i++ {
		out[i] = fib(i)
	}
	return out
}</pre>



<p>This function needs some tests, so let&#8217;s write some up real quick. We want to do some spot checking to make sure that the sequence is generated correctly. </p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">func TestFibAll(t *testing.T) {
	for i := int64(15); i &lt; 40; i++ {
		fibNumbers := fibAll(i)
		assert.NotNil(t, fibNumbers)
		assert.Len(t, fibNumbers, int(i+1))
		assert.Equal(t, 233, fibNumbers[13])
		assert.Equal(t, 55, fibNumbers[10])
	}
}</pre>



<p>We run our tests and get back this messy error.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">--- FAIL: TestFibAll (0.00s)
    fib_test.go:19: 
        	Error Trace:	fib_test.go:19
        	Error:      	Expected value not to be nil.
        	Test:       	TestFibAll
    fib_test.go:20: 
        	Error Trace:	fib_test.go:20
        	Error:      	"[]" should have 16 item(s), but has 0
        	Test:       	TestFibAll

	panic: runtime error: index out of range [13] with length 0

panic(0x719700, 0xc0000d42a0)
[Full stack trace omitted]
exit status 2
FAIL
</pre>



<p>As you can see,  the tests reported 2 failures instead of just one, and the code panicked. Of course, this is still usable and would be significantly better than nothing. However, if the unit tests were more complex, it can start to become unclear as to what the actual problem is. So, let&#8217;s put &#8220;require&#8221; to use.</p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="4,5" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">func TestFibAll(t *testing.T) {
	for i := int64(15); i &lt; 40; i++ {
		fibNumbers := fibAll(i)
		require.NotNil(t, fibNumbers)
		require.Len(t, fibNumbers, int(i+1))
		assert.Equal(t, 233, fibNumbers[13])
		assert.Equal(t, 55, fibNumbers[10])
	}
}</pre>



<p>When we run our tests, it becomes very clear what the issue is. </p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="raw" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">--- FAIL: TestFibAll (0.00s)
    fib_test.go:20: 
        	Error Trace:	fib_test.go:20
        	Error:      	Expected value not to be nil.
        	Test:       	TestFibAll
FAIL</pre>



<p>This is a significant improvement. Especially as the complexity of a codebase increases, simplified test failures can save you a lot of time. The last thing anyone wants to do is dig through a ton of logs and code, just to find that the issue is an inverted comparison. </p>



<p>Overall, Testify is a great library for reducing the complexity of your Go test code. Every time I have used it, I have been extremely satisfied, as the functions do exactly what they say. I strongly suggest checking out <a href="https://modulesafari.com/mockery-mock-everything-in-go/">the mock package and its use with mockery</a></p>

<p>Certmagic is a <a href="https://modulesafari.com/category/go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Golang (opens in a new tab)">Golang</a> library which allows to user to easily and automatically setup HTTPS on their application. So easy, that it can be done within a single line of code. Sounds crazy, doesn&#8217;t it? Well, let&#8217;s give it a try and see how well it works. For this review, I will be hosting it on the subdomain certmagic of this site. </p>



<h2>Setup</h2>



<p>I am going to glance over the setting up of the actual domain for this post, but the important part of this is that I have DNS set up correctly, and have a remote Linux host setup and running. Now, I just need to deploy the code to this host and see what happens, here is the code I used. </p>



<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">package main

import(
	"net/http"

	"github.com/gorilla/mux"
	"github.com/mholt/certmagic"
)

func main() {
	router := mux.NewRouter()
	router.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request){
		w.Write([]byte("Hello world"))
	}).Methods("GET", "OPTIONS")
	certmagic.HTTPS([]string{"certmagic.modulesafari.com"}, router)
}</pre>



<p>As you can see, the Go code is extremely simple, the call to Certmagic that initiates all of the logic to get the cert is a very simple one-liner, and can handle multiple domains. </p>



<h2>Execution</h2>



<p>So, I put this code on the server, compiled it, and then ran it. Within 10 seconds, it had already completed the acme-challenge and obtained a certificate. That is very impressive! I was expected to have the time to get a cup of coffee. I barely had time to get out of my chair. </p>

<p>Of course, I had to check in the browser to make sure, and behold, it&#8217;s alive!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://modulesafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/certmagic-proof.png" alt="certmagic browser https" class="wp-image-619" width="904" height="192" srcset="http://35.245.164.103/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/certmagic-proof.png 904w, http://35.245.164.103/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/certmagic-proof-480x102.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 904px, 100vw" /></figure>



<p>So, would I use Certmagic in production Golang services? It depends. I don&#8217;t imagine this being an effective solution if you are behind a load balancer. It also won&#8217;t work automagically if you are behind Cloudflare, I tried. The place were it really shines is when you have a very small service that you want to be secure. It is great for when you just want it to work on its own and not have to worry about it. It is definitely worth checking out, which you can do <a href="https://github.com/mholt/certmagic">here</a>. Props to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/mholt">mholt</a> for such a cool library! </p>

One of the places where logrus shines the brightest is its ability to be swapped into a codebase. You can easily change the global logger, which can be optimal for older, large codebases, since injecting a logger would not be reasonable. </div>

<p class="blog">While Logrus offers significantly more features than the built-in log package, it is also important to take performance into account. For this benchmark, I will be testing 4 logging cases: large string,  map, map with small members, and large string with caller reporting. The code used for this benchmark can be found <a href="https://github.com/moduledemos/logrus-demo">here</a>.</p></div>

As the complexity increases, Logrus gains traction against the build-in package. When logging a map, Logrus managed to get all the way down to a 1.75:1 ratio. Now, I wonder if Logrus would be able to beat out the default logger if we leverage this to its advantage. So, I put it in the most minimal mode I could find, and then ran it on a map with 1000 members. </p></div>

From the results, it is fairly safe to say that the difference in performance mainly results from the extra bells and whistles provided by the library. </p></div>

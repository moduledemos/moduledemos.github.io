<p> Any legal action of whatever nature brought by either you or us (collectively, the “Parties” and individually, a “Party”) shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Sussex County, Delaware, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. </p>



<p>Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms and Conditions. In no event shall any claim, action, or proceeding brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than 5 years after the cause of action arose.</p>



<h4>Option 2: Informal Negotiations</h4>



<p> To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms and Conditions (each a &#8220;Dispute&#8221; and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>



<h4>Option 3: Binding Arbitration</h4>



<p>If
the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded
below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding
arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD

</p>



<p>The

Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&#8220;AAA&#8221;)
and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for

arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of
documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision
in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless
requested by either Party. 
</p>



<p>The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Sussex County, Delaware.  </p>



<p>Except
as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to
compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to
confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by
the arbitrator.</p>



<p>If
for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration,
the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal
courts located in [name of county] County, [name of state], and the
Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal
jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and
jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms and Conditions.  </p>



<p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than 5 years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>



<h4>Option 2/Option 3: Restrictions</h4>
